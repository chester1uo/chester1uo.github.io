Hi! I am MPhil student at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Liu Chen](https://liuchen1993.cn/). My interests are: 

**1. Machine learning theory**, with a particular focus on robustness, privacy, and the security of machine learning models.

**2. Applications of large language models (LLMs) in FinTech**, especially towards enabling more intelligent and reliable investment decision-making.

Outside of academia, I have a keen interest in aviation ‚úàÔ∏è and photography üì∑. Additionally, I am an experienced investor in the U.S. and Hong Kong stock markets, including derivatives.
