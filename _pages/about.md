Hi! I am interested in machine learning thoery and application. Now I am MPhil student at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Liu Chen](https://liuchen1993.cn/). 

Outside of academia, I have a keen interest in aviation ‚úàÔ∏è and photography üì∑. Additionally, I am an experienced investor in the U.S. and Hong Kong stock markets, including derivatives.
