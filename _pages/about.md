Hi! I am MPhil student at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Liu Chen](https://liuchen1993.cn/). My interests are: 

**1. Machine learning theory**, with a particular focus on robustness, privacy, and the security of machine learning models.

**2. Multi-Agents Systems (MAS)**, design efficient and reliable multi-agent systems for a wide range of applications.

**3. Applications of large language models (LLMs) in FinTech**, especially towards enabling more intelligent and reliable investment decision-making. This work is conducted under the supervision and collaboration of Prof. Zhang Yuan at SUFE. My current main research areas include: (1) Trading signals, especially formulaic alpha factor mining; (2) Derivatives trading, with a focus on options.



Previously, I gained experience mainly in computer vision and model acceleration in industry.

Outside of academia, I have a keen interest in aviation ✈️ and photography 📷. Additionally, I am an experienced investor in the U.S. and Hong Kong stock markets, including derivatives.

## Contact Me

I am open to working with CityU Hong Kong undergraduate students who are looking for RMS or FYP projects and are interested in doing research in FinTech or AI for Finance (AI4Fin). Please contact Prof. Liu Chen. We can then propose a project that suits your background and interests, and I hope you can take the role of project leader to help drive the research forward.

I am also open to collaborating with CS6590 Master’s project students who would like to contribute to our ongoing research projects.
